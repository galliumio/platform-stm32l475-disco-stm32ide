License Terms for the QP frameworks from Quantum Leaps, LLC
===========================================================
The QP frameworks are licensed under the increasingly popular dual-
licensing model, in which both the open source and traditional
closed source software distribution models are combined.

NOTE: If your company has a policy forbidding open source in your
product, all QP frameworks can be licensed commercially, in which
case you don't use any open source license and you do not violate
your policy.


Open Source Projects
====================
If you are developing and distributing open source applications under
the GNU General Public License (GPL), as published by the Free Software
Foundation, then you are free to use all our QP™ frameworks under the
GPL version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
Please note that GPL requires that all modifications to the original
code as well as your application code (Derivative Works as defined in
the Copyright Law) must also be released under the terms of the GPL open
source license.

Exceptions to the GPLv3
-----------------------
We offer the following exceptions to the GPL:

Closed Source Projects
======================
If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source
applications, you can purchase one of Quantum Leaps commercial licenses,
which are specifically designed for users interested in retaining the
proprietary status of their code. All Quantum Leaps commercial licenses
expressly supersede the GPL open source license. This means that when you
license our QP frameworks under a commercial license, you specifically
do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you
are not subject to any of its terms. Commercial licensing options are
described at:
