// Include the following inline functions defined in ../qpcpp/source/qf_pkg.h.
// They are required to access private members of QEvt.
// Alternatively we can include ../qpcpp/source/qf_pkg.h. But that header file
// was intended for internal use within qpcpp.
// Note - In qpcpp 5.9.7 QF_EVT_POOL_ID_() and QF_EVT_REF_CTR_() were
//        removed from qf_pkg.h. They are still "friends" of class QEvt.
//        If they are removed as "friends" in the future they need to be patched.
